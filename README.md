# COVID-Chest-XRay-Classification

This is a group project that builds on state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and aims to
perform a classification of COVID chest x-ray data into important categories. Due to the use of a smaller
dataset, our implementations thoroughly fine-tune the following CNN base models: ResNet50,
EfficientNetB7, VGG-16, and NASNetMobile. These base models use selected pre-trained weights from
the ImageNet dataset. We also implement other extensions in terms of data pre-processing to improve
network learning.
